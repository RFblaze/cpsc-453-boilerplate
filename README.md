To run on vs code, install the cmake tools extension

Also install all the dependencies that prevent the build from working

Might need to run through command line for the first time before clicking the "run" button on the Cmake tools tab
This is done by moving the `453-skeleton.exe` file from build/Debug into build/ and running it manually in the command line. Then, the CMake tool will automatically pick it up.
